The plush is incredibly soft and cute, making it the perfect companion for my daughter wherever she goes. However, I did notice that one of the ears is slightly lower than the other, which seems like a design flaw rather than intentional asymmetry. Additionally, I found the size to be a bit smaller than expected given the price. I believe there are larger options available for the same cost. Despite this, the plush arrived a day earlier than anticipated, allowing me to enjoy it myself before gifting it to my daughter. Overall, while there are some minor flaws, the quality and cuteness of this panda plush make it a worthwhile purchase for any panda enthusiast."
